 * ----------------------------------------------------------
 * Most of RP-003 is not upsellable, and picking purely on value would surface
 * offers that are wrong to put in front of a customer as an invitation:
 *
 *   OFR-01 / OFR-08  are unlocked by producing a competitor's offer. Inviting a
 *                    customer to go shopping is a strange retention play, and
 *                    the higher number on OFR-08 would make it win on value
 *                    almost every time.
 *   OFR-04           its condition is a clawback disclosure, not something the
 *                    customer can go and satisfy.
 *   OFR-07           is amortisation relief governed by RP-006 credit risk. It
 *                    is a hardship path, and advertising it as an upgrade would
 *                    be crass as well as wrong.
 *   OFR-03 / OFR-06  are choices about the mortgage itself rather than about
 *                    bringing more to the bank.
 *
 * That leaves the two entries whose conditions really are "hold more with us".
 * They are listed explicitly so that adding an offer to the catalogue can never
 * silently start advertising it.
