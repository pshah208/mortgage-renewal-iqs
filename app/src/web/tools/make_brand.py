"""
Generate the CFC Bank demo brand marks.

The mark is an original geometric device drawn from scratch here - a shield
with three ascending bars knocked out of it. Nothing is traced from, or
derived from, any real institution's logo.

Knocking the bars out to full transparency rather than painting them white is
deliberate: the white variant sits on the brand-blue top bar, and letting the
bar show through keeps the mark legible at 26px instead of flattening it into
a solid blob.
