# Mortgage Renewal Concierge — synthetic data + ingestion runbook

A complete, ready-to-load synthetic dataset and upload runbook for building a
**Mortgage Renewal Concierge** agent in Azure AI Foundry, grounded across three
Microsoft intelligence layers.

Scenario: **CFC Bank**, FY26 180-day mortgage renewal campaign, three pilot
branches, as at **2026-08-03**.

> ⚠️ **Everything in this dataset is synthetic and illustrative.** CFC Bank is a
> **fictional institution** invented as a branding label for a demo. No person,
> customer, branch, balance,
> rate, internal policy, pricing guardrail, approval limit or governance decision
> here reflects any actual bank's data, product, process or position — all of
> it was generated for this demo. OSFI guideline numbers (B-20, B-21, E-21, E-23)
> are real public guidelines cited by name only; the policy text around them is
> invented. Do not present this as real bank information.

## Step 0 — Try it with zero Azure setup

Every tool falls back to the local synthetic files, so you can validate the whole
agent contract before wiring any backend:

```powershell
cd mortgage-renewal-concierge\agent
python create_agent.py --local-smoke
```

You should see segment rollups, the ranked high-risk customers with their
recommended offer and approval level, and the matching policy documents.

---

## Deploy everything (the short version)

```powershell
pip install -r requirements.txt
az login

.\deploy.ps1 -ResourceGroup <rg> -FabricCapacity <capacity> -WhatIf   # preview
.\deploy.ps1 -ResourceGroup <rg> -FabricCapacity <capacity>           # apply
```

`deploy.ps1` runs Bicep → Fabric IQ → Foundry IQ → Work IQ → agent in dependency
order, wiring each stage's outputs into the next. Use `-Only <stage>` to run one
stage, `-SkipWorkIq` to leave Microsoft 365 alone.

**Bicep covers the Azure control plane only** — AI Search service, Foundry account,
project, model deployment, Fabric capacity and role assignments. The Fabric
workspace, the search index, the M365 content and the agent itself are data-plane
or Graph objects with no ARM provider, so they come from the Python scripts. See
[`infra/README.md`](infra/README.md) for the full split.

The rest of this document is the **manual walkthrough**, layer by layer.

---

## Step 1 — Fabric IQ → Microsoft Fabric (OneLake + semantic model)

**Data:** `data/fabric-iq/*.csv` · **Target:** workspace `ws-mortgage-renewals-demo`

### Automated (recommended)

`deploy_fabric.py` does the whole thing idempotently using your `az login`:

```powershell
cd mortgage-renewal-concierge\data\fabric-iq
pip install requests
az login

python deploy_fabric.py --capacity <your-capacity-name>
python deploy_fabric.py --status          # show what exists + the env vars to set
```

It creates, in order:

| # | Artifact | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Workspace `ws-mortgage-renewals-demo` | bound to the named capacity; the synthetic-data disclaimer goes in the workspace description |
| 2 | Lakehouse `lh_mortgage_renewals` | plus its SQL analytics endpoint |
| 3 | `Files/renewals/*.csv` in OneLake | uploaded via the OneLake ADLS Gen2 API |
| 4 | Notebook `nb_load_renewals` | run as a job → 5 base + 2 curated Delta tables |
| 5 | Notebook `nb_create_semantic_model` | run as a job → Direct Lake model `sm_mortgage_renewals` with 2 relationships and 15 measures |

Individual steps: `--only workspace|lakehouse|upload|notebook|semantic-model`.

> The capacity must be **Active**. If it is paused:
> `az rest --method post --url "https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/<sub>/resourceGroups/<rg>/providers/Microsoft.Fabric/capacities/<name>/resume?api-version=2023-11-01"`

### Tables produced

| Table | Rows | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `customers` · `mortgage_renewals` · `renewal_risk_scores` · `retention_offers` · `branch_performance` | 50 / 50 / 50 / 8 / 3 | raw synthetic source |
| `renewal_attrition_risk` | 50 | **curated fact** — everything joined, filtered to 180 days, plus `ltv_band`, `payment_shock_band` and `maturity_bucket` |
| `renewal_segment_summary` | 5 | segment rollup |

> Why tables and not views: Spark SQL views live only in the Spark metastore. They
> are **not** visible through the SQL analytics endpoint and cannot back a Direct
> Lake semantic model. Materialising the curated layer as Delta tables means the
> same objects serve the SQL endpoint, the semantic model and the agent.

### Semantic model `sm_mortgage_renewals`

Direct Lake over the curated tables — reads the Parquet in OneLake directly, so
there is no import and no refresh schedule. It carries the business definitions so
they are stated once rather than re-derived in every query:

| Measure | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `Renewals in 180 Days`, `Balance Maturing` | population and size of the book |
| `Annual Revenue Exposure`, `Five Year Lifetime Value` | what is at stake |
| **`Value at Risk`** | `SUMX(exposure × attrition_risk_score)` — probability-weighted. This is the sort order the 20 July Renewal Council asked for |
| `High Risk Renewals`, `High Risk Exposure`, `Pct Balance At High Risk` | risk concentration |
| `Balance Above 80 LTV`, `Balance Above 60 Pct Payment Shock` | the CRO's monthly-pack splits required by policy RP-009 |
| `Avg Renewal Likelihood Pct`, `Avg Payment Shock Pct`, `Avg Competitor Gap Bps`, `Avg LTV Pct`, `Rate Shopping Signals` | campaign diagnostics |

Relationships: `renewal_attrition_risk` → `retention_offers` (offer catalogue) and
→ `branch_performance` (branch rollup).

### Wire the agent

```powershell
$env:FABRIC_WORKSPACE_ID    = "<workspace guid from --status>"
$env:FABRIC_SEMANTIC_MODEL  = "sm_mortgage_renewals"
# optional SQL fallback
$env:FABRIC_SQL_ENDPOINT    = "<...>.datawarehouse.fabric.microsoft.com"
$env:FABRIC_DATABASE        = "lh_mortgage_renewals"
```

The `query_renewal_analytics` tool resolves its backend in this order:

1. **Semantic model** via the Power BI `executeQueries` DAX endpoint — preferred,
   because the agent then consumes the *governed measures* rather than re-deriving
   business logic in SQL. Needs no ODBC driver.
2. **SQL analytics endpoint** via `pyodbc` — requires **ODBC Driver 18 for SQL Server**.
3. **Local CSVs** — so a demo never hard-fails.

The tool reports which one it used in its `mode` field.

### Manual alternative

If you'd rather click through it: create the workspace and assign capacity, create
the Lakehouse, upload the CSVs to `Files/renewals/`, create a notebook from
`load_renewals_fabric.py` and run it, then a second notebook from
`create_semantic_model_fabric.py` and run that.

**Verify:** `python deploy_fabric.py --status`, then in the Fabric portal open
`sm_mortgage_renewals` and check the measures appear on `renewal_attrition_risk`.

> 💸 **Pause the capacity when you're done.** The live `fabcap26` is an **F8** and
> bills while Active.
> `az rest --method post --url "https://management.azure.com/<capacity-resource-id>/suspend?api-version=2023-11-01"`

---

## Step 2 — Work IQ → Microsoft 365 (Exchange · Teams · SharePoint)

**Data:** `data/work-iq/` · **Target:** a **non-production / demo tenant**

> ⚠️ This writes into user mailboxes and creates a Team. Do not run it in a
> production tenant.

### 2a. Provision the app registration

```powershell
cd mortgage-renewal-concierge\data\work-iq
pip install azure-identity requests
az login                                   # as Global Administrator

python provision_seeder_app.py             # creates app + SP, grants + consents, issues secret
python provision_seeder_app.py --show      # report state, change nothing
python provision_seeder_app.py --enable-device-code --no-secret
python provision_seeder_app.py --delete    # tear down when the demo is over
```

Application permissions granted (admin consent applied directly via
`appRoleAssignments`): `User.Read.All` · `User.ReadWrite.All` · `Mail.ReadWrite` ·
`Group.ReadWrite.All` · `Team.Create` · `TeamMember.ReadWrite.All` ·
`Channel.Create` · `ChannelMessage.Read.All` · `Files.ReadWrite.All` ·
`Sites.ReadWrite.All`.

> **`ChannelMessage.Send` does not exist as an application permission** — it is
> delegated-only. App-only posting instead requires `Teamwork.Migrate.All` and
> works only against a team created in *migration mode*; Graph otherwise returns
> *"Message POST is allowed in application-only context only for import purposes."*
> So the Teams **messages** step uses delegated device-code auth. Everything else
> (team, channels, members, mail, files) runs app-only.

> Treat the client secret as sensitive: it is printed once, never written to disk
> by the script, and should not be committed. Delete the app when finished.

### 2b. Map the personas onto licensed accounts

> **Do not create 14 new users.** A user without an Exchange Online licence has no
> mailbox (the mail import fails), and without a Microsoft 365 Copilot licence
> Work IQ cannot ground on their content. Check your headroom first:
>
> ```powershell
> az rest --method get --url "https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/subscribedSkus" `
>   --query "value[].{sku:skuPartNumber,enabled:prepaidUnits.enabled,used:consumedUnits}" -o table
> ```
>
> Most demo tenants are fully consumed. The supported path is to **map the personas
> onto existing licensed users**.

`user_mapping.json` holds that mapping — persona alias → real UPN, display name,
job title and department. Edit it for your tenant, then:

```powershell
python seed_work_iq.py --auth cli --check-users          # confirm all 14 resolve
python seed_work_iq.py --auth cli --map-users --dry-run  # preview the renames
python seed_work_iq.py --auth cli --map-users            # apply
```

`--map-users` snapshots each account's original `displayName` / `jobTitle` /
`department` to **`user_mapping.restore.json`** before patching. Keep that file —
it is how you undo the change:

```powershell
python seed_work_iq.py --auth cli --restore-users
```

Mail renders `displayName`, so renaming is what makes the narrative read correctly
without creating unlicensable users. UPNs, mailboxes and licences are untouched.

### 2c. Pick the demo driver

Work IQ grounds **only on content the signed-in user can access**, so the account
you sign in as to ask the question matters more than where the data nominally sits.

`driver_alias` in `user_mapping.json` names that account — **Raj Balakrishnan**
(VP, Real Estate Secured Lending) by default. He chairs the Renewal Council, so he
legitimately sits across all four categories the demo question asks for, and he is
the most-connected persona in the corpus (on 11 of 18 emails and 5 Teams threads).
The seeder **cc's the driver on any email he is not already party to**, so nothing
in the corpus is invisible to him.

### 2d. Seed

```powershell
cd mortgage-renewal-concierge\data\work-iq
pip install azure-identity requests

$env:WORKIQ_TENANT_ID     = "<tenant-guid>"
$env:WORKIQ_CLIENT_ID     = "<app-client-id>"
$env:WORKIQ_CLIENT_SECRET = "<client-secret>"

python seed_work_iq.py --all --dry-run                              # preview every Graph call
python seed_work_iq.py --only mail --purge                         # 18 emails → inboxes + sent
python seed_work_iq.py --only teams                                # team + 3 channels + 14 members
python seed_work_iq.py --only teams --messages-only --auth device  # 43 channel messages
python seed_work_iq.py --only files                                # notes → SharePoint + OneDrive
```

`--purge` deletes previously seeded copies (matched on subject) first, so
re-running does not duplicate the corpus.

What lands where:

| Content | Destination |
|---|---|
| 18 emails | each recipient's **Inbox** and the author's **Sent Items**, with original sender, recipients, importance and **original timestamp** |
| 1 team, 3 channels, 12 threads + 31 replies (**43 messages**) | Team **Retail Mortgage Renewals FY26** → *Renewal Campaign - 180 Day*, *Branch Leaders Forum*, *Pricing Exceptions* |
| 4 meeting records + the source JSON | the team's SharePoint library under `Renewal Campaign/Meetings` and `Renewal Campaign/Source`, plus the driver's OneDrive |

> **Timestamp fidelity.** Exchange silently rewrites `sentDateTime` /
> `receivedDateTime` to *now* on create, collapsing the June–August narrative into
> a single day. The seeder therefore also sets the underlying MAPI properties —
> `PR_CLIENT_SUBMIT_TIME` (`SystemTime 0x0039`) and `PR_MESSAGE_DELIVERY_TIME`
> (`SystemTime 0x0E06`) — which Exchange does honour. The story arc then reads and
> sorts correctly.

> **App-only team creation accepts exactly one member.** The team is created with
> the owner and the other 13 are added via the members collection. Membership is
> re-ensured on every run, so `--only teams` is safe to repeat.

> The delegated account used for the messages step must be a **member of the
> team**, otherwise posting returns 403.

**Verify:** sign in as the driver, confirm the inbox shows the campaign threads
dated June–August, and the Team shows all three channels. Allow **15–30 minutes**
for Microsoft 365 / Copilot indexing before querying Work IQ.

---

## Step 3 — Foundry IQ → Azure AI Search

**Data:** `data/foundry-iq/renewal_policies.json` · **Target:** index `renewal-policies`

```powershell
# 1. Reuse an existing Search service if you have one - check first
az resource list --resource-type Microsoft.Search/searchServices -o table

# ...or provision one (Basic tier is sufficient for this corpus)
az search service create -g <rg> -n <search-name> --sku Basic -l canadacentral

# 2. Semantic ranking must be enabled for the agent's semantic query path.
#    The 'free' tier allows 1,000 semantic queries/month at no cost.
az search service update -g <rg> -n <search-name> --semantic-search free

# 3. (optional) enable Entra auth alongside keys
az search service update -g <rg> -n <search-name> --auth-options aadOrApiKey

# 4. Create the index and upload the corpus
cd mortgage-renewal-concierge\data\foundry-iq
pip install azure-search-documents==11.5.2 azure-identity

$env:SEARCH_ENDPOINT  = "https://<search-name>.search.windows.net"
$env:SEARCH_ADMIN_KEY = (az search admin-key show -g <rg> --service-name <search-name> --query primaryKey -o tsv)
$env:SEARCH_INDEX     = "renewal-policies"
python index_renewal_policies.py
```

> If `--semantic-search` is left disabled, index creation still succeeds but the
> agent's semantic query fails at run time and silently falls back to the local
> JSON corpus. Check the `live` field in the tool's response to confirm.

The corpus (10 documents, keyword + semantic ranking):

| Id | Title | Category |
|---|---|---|
| RP-001 | Renewal Pricing Guardrails — National Discount Grid | `pricing_guardrail` |
| RP-002 | Discretionary Pricing Approval Matrix and Competitor Evidence Standard | `approval_requirement` |
| RP-003 | Retention Offer Catalogue — Eligibility and Approval | `approval_requirement` |
| RP-004 | OSFI Guideline B-20 — Application to Mortgage Renewals | `regulatory_reference` |
| RP-005 | OSFI Guideline E-23 — Model Risk Management for the Attrition Model | `regulatory_reference` |
| RP-006 | Amortization Relief Fast Path for Straight Renewals | `approval_requirement` |
| RP-007 | Fair Treatment of Clients at Renewal — Conduct and Disclosure | `risk_consideration` |
| RP-008 | Regional Pricing Variation — Governance and Evidence | `pricing_guardrail` |
| RP-009 | Renewal Portfolio Risk Considerations and Concentration Limits | `risk_consideration` |
| RP-010 | Renewal Escalation Procedure and Service Standards | `approval_requirement` |

**Verify:** in the portal, *Search explorer* on `renewal-policies`, query
`approval authority above 25 bps` — RP-001 and RP-002 should rank top. Or check
the tool end to end (`live: true` means it reached AI Search):

```powershell
python ..\..\agent\create_agent.py --local-smoke
```

Retrieval spot-checks that should each return the named policy first:

| Question | Expected top hit |
|---|---|
| who approves a rate discount above 25 basis points | RP-001 / RP-002 |
| what evidence is needed for a competitor rate match | RP-002 |
| does the stress test apply to a straight mortgage renewal | RP-004 (B-20) |
| can we extend amortization without re-underwriting | RP-006 |
| model governance for the attrition score | RP-005 (E-23) |
| concentration risk from retaining high LTV borrowers | RP-009 |

To use it as a **Foundry knowledge source** instead of a function tool: in the
Foundry portal go to your project → **Knowledge → + Add → Azure AI Search**,
point it at this index, and attach it to the agent.

---

## Step 4 — Build the Foundry agent

```powershell
cd mortgage-renewal-concierge\agent
pip install azure-ai-agents==1.1.0 azure-identity==1.19.0 azure-search-documents==11.5.2 requests pyodbc

$env:FOUNDRY_PROJECT_ENDPOINT = "https://<res>.services.ai.azure.com/api/projects/<proj>"
$env:FOUNDRY_MODEL            = "gpt-4.1"     # any deployment in that project

python create_agent.py --create      # create/update the agent + its 3 tools
python create_agent.py --demo        # run all three demo questions
python create_agent.py --chat        # interactive
```

The three function tools appear in the Foundry portal under
**Agents → mortgage-renewal-concierge → Tools**. The system prompt lives in
`agent/agent_instructions.md` between the `INSTRUCTIONS-START/END` markers —
edit there and re-run `--create` to update.

### Identity and roles

| To do this | Grant |
|---|---|
| Create/run agents from your user | **Azure AI User** (or Contributor) on the Foundry project |
| Run agents from a managed identity | see `mortgage-iq-app/README.md` → *Required role (agents data plane)* — needs a custom role with `Microsoft.CognitiveServices/accounts/AIServices/*` data actions |
| Read the AI Search index with Entra | **Search Index Data Reader** on the search service |
| Query the Fabric semantic model | **Viewer** on the workspace + **Read** on the semantic model (workspace Member/Contributor covers both) |
| Query the Fabric SQL endpoint | workspace **Viewer**/**Member**, plus ODBC Driver 18 locally |
| Search M365 content | delegated `Mail.Read`, `ChannelMessage.Read.All`, `Files.Read.All` |

---

## Data design notes

**Fabric IQ.** 50 renewals maturing 6–180 days out, across 5 segments and
3 branches. Legacy rates 1.79–3.24% renewing into 4.09–5.34%, producing payment
shock of roughly 30–140%. The attrition score is a transparent weighted function
of competitor rate gap, payment shock, product depth, primary-relationship flag,
origination channel, digital engagement, rate-shopping signal, complaints and
tenure — so any score the agent quotes is explainable, which is the point of the
OSFI E-23 thread in the policy corpus. Risk mix is roughly 16 High / 22 Medium /
12 Low. Recommended offers are validated against the eligibility rules in
`retention_offers.csv`.

**Work IQ.** The corpus is deliberately built so the four requested return
categories are each discoverable and *conflict with one another*:

- **Branch leader concerns** — three genuinely different problems: BR-101 advisor
  capacity, BR-202 competitor pricing in Québec, BR-303 payment shock among
  self-employed clients. Plus a cross-branch gap: unowned broker-originated renewals.
- **Advisor feedback** — approval latency, no view of relationship value, lists
  sorted by maturity rather than value at risk, stale pricing grid, French-language
  gaps, clients asking about *payment* while the script leads with *rate*.
- **Rate escalations** — RNW-5014 (32 bps requested → 28 bps approved with three
  conditions), RNW-5033 (what counts as competitor evidence), three BR-303
  amortization-relief files, and the Québec regional grid request.
- **Executive guidance** — Diane Lafleur's three non-negotiables and 60-day
  direction, Karen Whitfield's four risk conditions, Helena Vasquez's compliance
  items. Threads recur across email, Teams and meetings so a summary has to
  reconcile them rather than repeat one source.

**Foundry IQ.** Written so the answers to "what's allowed / who approves" are
unambiguous and interlocking: RP-001 sets the guardrails, RP-002 the approval
matrix and tiered evidence standard, RP-003 offer eligibility, RP-004/RP-005/RP-009
the OSFI B-20, E-23 and E-21 hooks, RP-006 the amortization fast path with its
three hard conditions, RP-007 conduct, RP-008 regional grid governance and
RP-010 the escalation procedure.

## Regenerating

```powershell
python data\fabric-iq\generate_fabric_data.py   # deterministic - same output every run
```

Change `SEED`, `AS_OF` or the segment/branch tables at the top of that file to
reshape the dataset. The Work IQ and Foundry IQ corpora are hand-authored JSON —
edit them directly and re-run the seeding/indexing scripts.
