# Security Audits

## Overview

Security audits are systematic examinations of codebases to identify vulnerabilities, security flaws, and potential attack vectors. This guide outlines the process for conducting thorough security audits of software projects.

## Purpose

Security audits help you:
- Identify security vulnerabilities before they're exploited
- Validate security controls and implementations
- Ensure compliance with security standards
- Build confidence in code security posture

## When to Conduct Security Audits

- Before releasing new features or major updates
- After integrating third-party dependencies
- When security concerns are raised
- As part of regular security review cycles
- Before deployment to production environments

## Security Audit Process

### 1. Preparation Phase

**Review the README.md**
- Understand the project's purpose and architecture
- Identify key components and data flows
- Note authentication and authorization mechanisms
- Review dependencies and external integrations

**Gather Context**
- Review this documentation at `audits/security/README.md`
- Select appropriate templates from `audits/security/`
- Understand the scope and objectives of the audit

### 2. Audit Execution

**Static Analysis**
- Review code for common vulnerabilities (OWASP Top 10)
- Check for hardcoded secrets and credentials
- Analyze authentication and authorization logic
- Review input validation and sanitization
- Examine cryptography usage
- Check for insecure dependencies

**Dynamic Analysis**
- Test authentication flows
- Attempt common injection attacks
- Test access controls
- Verify security headers
- Check for information disclosure

**Configuration Review**
- Review security settings
- Check environment variable handling
- Examine deployment configurations
- Validate CORS and CSP policies

### 3. Documentation

**Record Findings**
- Use templates from `audits/security/`
- Document each vulnerability with:
  - Description and impact
  - Severity rating (Critical, High, Medium, Low)
  - Reproduction steps
  - Recommended remediation
  - References and resources

**Store Results**
- Save completed audit reports to `audits/security/`
- Use clear naming: `YYYY-MM-DD-project-name-audit.md`
- Include executive summary and detailed findings

### 4. Remediation & Follow-up

- Prioritize findings by severity and impact
- Create tracking issues for each vulnerability
- Verify fixes after implementation
- Schedule follow-up audits as needed

## Common Vulnerability Categories

| Category | Examples | Tools |
|----------|----------|-------|
| **Injection** | SQL injection, command injection, XSS | SQLMap, Burp Suite |
| **Authentication** | Weak passwords, session fixation, broken auth | Custom scripts, manual review |
| **Authorization** | Broken access control, privilege escalation | Manual testing |
| **Sensitive Data** | Exposed secrets, weak encryption | TruffleHog, git-secrets |
| **Dependencies** | Known vulnerabilities in libraries | npm audit, Snyk, Dependabot |
| **Configuration** | Insecure defaults, missing headers | Nikto, SSL Labs |

## Security Audit Tools

### Static Analysis
- **GitHub Advanced Security**: Code scanning with CodeQL
- **Snyk**: Dependency vulnerability scanning
- **SonarQube**: Code quality and security analysis
- **Bandit**: Python security linter
- **ESLint Security Plugins**: JavaScript security rules

### Dynamic Analysis
- **Burp Suite**: Web application security testing
- **OWASP ZAP**: Automated vulnerability scanning
- **Postman**: API security testing
- **curl**: Manual request testing

### Secrets Detection
- **TruffleHog**: Git repository secret scanning
- **git-secrets**: Prevent committing secrets
- **detect-secrets**: Pre-commit hook for secrets

## Best Practices

✅ **Do:**
- Follow the security audit process systematically
- Document all findings, even low-severity issues
- Test both happy paths and edge cases
- Consider the entire attack surface
- Use automated tools combined with manual review
- Verify fixes after remediation

❌ **Don't:**
- Skip documentation in favor of quick fixes
- Focus only on obvious vulnerabilities
- Ignore low-severity findings
- Rely solely on automated tools
- Test on production systems without permission
- Share sensitive findings outside secure channels

## Templates

Use the templates in `audits/security/` to structure your audit work:

- `audit-checklist.md` - Comprehensive checklist for audits
- `vulnerability-report.md` - Template for documenting findings
- `executive-summary.md` - High-level report template
- `remediation-plan.md` - Action plan for fixing issues

## Example Audit Workflow

```bash
# 1. Start with the project README
cat README.md

# 2. Review this security audit guide
cat audits/security/README.md

# 3. Copy audit templates
cp audits/security/audit-checklist.md audits/security/2024-02-01-myproject-audit.md

# 4. Run automated security scans
npm audit
snyk test

# 5. Perform manual code review
# Review authentication, authorization, input validation, etc.

# 6. Document findings in the audit report
# Include severity, impact, and remediation steps

# 7. Store results
git add audits/security/2024-02-01-myproject-audit.md
git commit -m "Security audit report for myproject"
```

**Remember**: Security audits are about building confidence in your code's security posture. Be thorough, be systematic, and document everything.
